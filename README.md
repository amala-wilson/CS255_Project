# CS255_Project
The contents of this repository pertain to the project worked on in CS255

tsp_nn_vns.py, tsp_random_nn_vns.py, and tsp_seed_vns.py contains the code that is used to figure out which method is deemed a best fit to generate an initial solution for VNS to solve the k-TSP problem

tsp_nn_vnd.py, tsp_random_nn_vnd.py, and tsp_seed_vnd.py contains the code that is used to figure out which method is deemed a best fit to generate an initial solution for VND to solve the k-TSP problem

tsp_seed_gvns.py contains the original GVNS solution

tsp_seed_gvns_cp.py contains the randomization approach I took towards solving the k-TSP problem using GVNS
